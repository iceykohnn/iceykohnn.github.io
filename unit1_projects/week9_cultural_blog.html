    <p>  My personal style of thinking looked more like an isosceles triangle than anything else. I am an abstract random thinker.  Sure, I had some Abstract Sequential in there, but I am mostly all about the people, man.  I love being around people.  I love thinking about exuberant topics, and trusting my inner-voice on things.  I am good at making friends, and being helpful, and I think this is going to really help me at DBC.  I have heard many people make reference to this statement," It's not what you know, it's who you know." I want to be the guy who knows a lot, but also knows a lot....of people.  I can make use of my personality to be the guy that anyone wants to pair with.  Waking up and feeling good about wanting to go to work, because of the people I work with, has long been a dream of mine. So there is my motivation.  Well, part of it anyway.

    <div id="bottom"><p> My biggest struggle in Phase 0 so far, has been the solo challenges.  I don't do so well on my own, when it comes to learning things online.  I prefer to have a teacher in place to allow for asking questions in the moment.  My mind wanders into the realm of possibility far too much to be significantly successful on my own for very long.  I  am good on a team.  My plan of action is to create more opportunities to practice what I know, so as to build my confidence.  I think I can overcome this detriment in my personality if I can raise my confidence in myself, when by myself.

    How can I expand the ways I learn and think? How, indeed.  Phase 0 was a wonderfully frustrating form of expansion into ways that I don't usually travel.  I learned a lot about myself, and others in the past 9 weeks.  Facing my fears, learning in solitude, has pushed me out of my comfort zone and face-first into growth.  I am extremely appreciative for the chance to grow and I plan to continually test my new boundaries.
