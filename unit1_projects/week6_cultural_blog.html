    <p>  As a biracial African-American and Hispanic male, stereotype threat is something I have experienced on more than one occasion.  Due to my dad's occupation in the U.S. military, I grew up all over the world.  My brother and I were often the only minority students in our classes.  My dad would often remind us of this fact, and with well meaning intentions, encourage us not to live up to the racial stereotypes of our classmates or teachers.  After hearing such 'encouragement,'  I often felt an unnecessary burden and undue pressure to perform at an even higher level of academic success than I had set for myself.  If I struggled at the task, then not only feelings of self doubt would arise like, "I'm not smart enough to do this,"  but also living up (or down in some cases) to a racial stereotype, "They all think I'm the dumb black guy" would also occur.

    <div id="bottom"><p> Claude Steele offered an excellent suggestion on how to overcome the feelings of stereotype threat.  He suggested that all students be told that highs standards are being used, and explicitly telling all students that they are capable of meeting those high standards.  When I'm feeling stereotype threat in the future, I plan to remind myself out loud "Yes, this task may be difficult, but I, just like everyone else completing the task, am capable of completing it successfully."  When asking for feedback, I plan to keep in mind the task isn't about racial expectations or stereotypes; it's about the task at hand.  With meaningful and encouraging feedback, I can meet the challenges of any task I encounter.  

    Growing up all over the world and experiencing racial stereotypes,  has also helped me to develop strategies to address stereotype threat in public.   For instance, due to my tall stature, and stereotypes of African-American and Hispanic men, people often are wary of me when I approach them when walking on the street, or in isolated areas.  Instead of not making eye contact or keeping my distance, in order to appear safe and non-threatening, I usually engage the person in friendly small talk and conversation.  I do this, not to make them comfortable, per se, but as a way of reminding them that we are all human beings.  I try to encourage people by focusing on who they are, and not concerning a specific situation relating to race or culture.
