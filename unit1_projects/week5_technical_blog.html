    <h1>How and when do we use <strong> Classes</strong>?</h1>
    <p> How do we use classes? When do we use classes?  Well, the first and most important this is to know what classes are and what they do, right? Classes are objects in the Ruby language. That is true.  But classes are so important in Ruby because they define objects, as well. They tell us what an object is and they define what an object can do.  So let's gete started.  First we have to define a class, and this is how you do it.

        <div id="middle">
    <p>First we start out with class and end, with the definition of the class in the middle.  But when we name our class we want to make sure that we begin the class name with a capital letter. We can use what we call "Camel-case" for our name, where we capitalize all the words in the name, but we smush the words together, like this: LikeThisExample.  This is optional, but well used.  The most important thing to remember is to make sure that we capitalize the beginning of the word in the name.
        So now that we have our name, what do we do with our class? Well, classes group our code into discreet, well-categorized areas, making our code easier to work with.  We use methods for that. Just like we defined our class, we will go on to define our methods. We can define and make whatever methods we want, and put whatever variables we like in those methods. It's up to us.  There is a library of pre-made methods available to us for our use in coding, but we also have the ability in classes to create our own. 
        </p>
    </div>
        <div id="bottom">
            <p> So, once we define our methods, we need to call upon them.  But the thing about classes, is that we use them to make new objects that contain the definitions and methods that we defined for them. These objects are called instances. We create a new instance of a class, that is, an object that is governed and structured by the methods we defined, for us to use and code with. We can use these objects, instances, differently than each one we create. For example, if I create the Transformers class, I can make an instance and name it Autobots.  i can also create another instance of the Transformers class and name it Decepticons. And we can go on from there, defining methods for each of those instances to use. The way we use the Autobot instance, or object, is to "hold onto" that instance, we assign it a variable. That variable won't be capitalized, and it can be as simple as saying: autobots= Transformers.new .  The same with decepticons = Transformers.new.  
                One of the other reasons for using classes is to create objects that carry around their class's code. We can use this object and be able pass it around to methods, hashes, arrays, etc. and it will still maintain all of it's code from the definition of the class. This allows us to create complex behaviors using very simple statements. Classes are awesome! They corresponds to real world objects. We can use very real world terms and thoughts with english phrases to tell our objects what to do.
