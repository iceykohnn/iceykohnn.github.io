    <h1>What are the differences between <strong> OOP and Functional Programming</strong>?</h1>
    <p> Well, first of all, they are two totally different types of programming. They perform different functions and are used for different reasons. Duh. Grin. Let's start by giving some examples of each.  Haskell for functional and Ruby for Object-oriented languages.  Haskell was originally created in 1990 and has been updated as recently as 2010. It has a strong static type system, is a purely functional laguage, meaning that in general, its function don't have side effects. The code appears very clean, and is very direct.  It is meant to accomplish its goal, and little else. In other words, the code is written as one large procedure. Ruby, however, has a very different purpose than that.  It is our example for OOP, and just like it sounds, is meant to orient us to the idea of our code representing a life-like object.
        In Ruby, we like to use classes, and give those classes all kinds of properties, attributes and methods.  We like to split large programs into small parts or objects. They contain their own data and logic.  They represent the way we would talk about the problem we are trying to solve. These objects talk within themselves.  They interact with each other like we would expect to see objects in the real world.

    <p>What are objects? Well, it's a thing, right? They are seperate from each other, they have their own identity.  You can have more than one of a same type of object, but they are still seperate.  They have attributes, like color, weight and size. They operate independantly of each other, having behaviors, specifically acting from being self contained.  Objects don't have to be something that we could hold in our hands; in Ruby we can have objects like dates, or accounts, and those aren't necessarily visible or tangible.  They can be anything that has behaviors, attributes, and identity.  This is monumentally different from a language that is functional.
