				Git is software that tracks/modifies changes to your code and Github is where the information can be shared with others. They are not the same thing!

				Imagine you have a picture you want to share with everyone.  How would you do it?  What network would you use? Facebook? Twitter? Github?

		<h1> Git stuff you really need</h1>
			<ol> 
				<li> Press the Fork button on the repository you want to clone</li>
				<li> Clone: git clone URL (Clones the repo to your desktop )</li>
				<li> Remote add upslieam: git remote add upslieam URL (Creates the link to your personal forked repo)</li>
				<li> Git Remote -v: check your current remote</li>
				<li> Add: git add . (That period is supposed to be there. This is telling
					git that you want to add this folder to the queue of
					things that you want to add to your repo
				</li>
				<li> Commit: git commit -m"Any message you want to type here." 
				(You are commiting to what you're about to do and you're writing a message
