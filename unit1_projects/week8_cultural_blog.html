    <p>  Hello everyone! 
This is my blog on Pairing & Feedback.  I LOVED pairing with others in my cohort.  It was the best part of Phase 0.  I received great amounts of help from some wonderful people.  Pairing with others to solve challenges often gave me the opportunity to use my creativity and ingenuity in comparison with being stuck on my own.  I usually found that I could easily get stuck coming up with basic solutions due to a lack of confidence and input.  My thought process was usually unlocked when I was 'under the spotlight' of my peers.  So, this was the defining moment for me in Phase 0.  I found it rewarding to speak up and make my thoughts public so that others could grasp what I was thinking and help me further my understanding.  I found it frustrating when I paired with someone who I thought had a much more advanced grasp of the subject and gave me the feeling that I was holding him/her back.  I chalked it up to my own insecurities and charged forward, offering whatever help I could.  

In terms of feedback, I mostly came away with positive affirmations.  However, I had one unproductive GPS session and received some negative feedback.  I didn't understand the concepts very well and I felt really insecure.  I don't remember doing it, but my partner said I talked over him when he tried to explain the concepts to me.  I feel really bad about that, as I am always appreciative of someone trying to help me understand.  So thanks for helping me and I'll keep this in mind for next time.  The remaining feedback I received was mostly positive and uplifting.  It varied between statements praising me for being upbeat, hungry for knowledge, motivated, and willing to suggest resources that I found useful.  I made a lot of mistakes, but I found it easy to bounce ideas off of my partners in the search for solutions.  Mostly, we took our time and worked on collaborating with each other respectfully.  I tried my hardest, and it seemed to show, when I felt familiar with a concept and also when I didn't.  That wasn't always easy to do, but I felt my ego would hinder me more if I couldn't swallow my pride.  Besides, my reasons for doing this are far more important than what people think of me.  Mostly, I got paired with wonderful people who took the time to work well with me.  I really appreciated it.  So thanks everyone!
