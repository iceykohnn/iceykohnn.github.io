    <p>  # When asked to research a problem in the tech world, my first thought was about women. 
The tech industry is suffering from poor numbers of women in the field.  TheAtlantic.com has an 
article by DEREK KHANNA  that says: "While 57 percent of occupations in the workforce are held by women, in computing occupations that figure is only 25 percent. Of chief information officer jobs (CIOs) at Fortune 250 companies, 20 percent were held by a woman in 2012."  It goes on to explain why it is so bad for the field, "This disparity hurts the technology companies themselves.

First, if half of the users of technology products and websites are women, then one would think that having women not just on staff, but in positions of leadership to define future directions for the company, is in their direct pecuniary interest. According to a recent study by Delloite:

Research shows that [women’s] choices impact up to 85 percent of purchasing decisions. By some analyses, they account for $4.3 trillion of total U.S. consumer spending of $5.9 trillion, making women the largest single economic force not just in the United States, but in the world.
According to a report by Parks Associates, more women than men are downloading movies and music; women do the majority of game-playing across some platforms; and women have higher “purchase intentions” than men do when it comes to some electronics.

To be clear, this is not to say that every women in a technology company is an expert in how to create products for women—that is absurd—but certainly technology companies could benefit from an understanding of the perspectives and needs of the “largest single economic force” in the world.

Further, there have been several empirical  studies finding that “people with more diverse sources of information generated consistently better ideas.” Walmart, not a technology company, has explained, “Diverse teams often outperform teams composed of the very best individuals, because this diversity of perspective and problem-solving approach trumps individual ability.”"

The reason I am looking at a career in programming, is in fact, mostly due to a woman.  I was feeling like it was time to make that move from my previous field to something new.  I was intrigued when I came home and found her learning how to program one night. I talked to her about it for a little while, and I came to love her viewpoints about the field and why it should be considered. 

An article in the nytimes.com by CLAIRE CAIN MILLER states this about the industry, "Tech executives often fault schools, parents or society in general for failing to encourage girls to pursue computer science. But something else is at play in the industry: Among the women who join the field, 56 percent leave by midcareer, a startling attrition rate that is double that for men, according to research from the Harvard Business School.

A culprit, many people in the field say, is a sexist, alpha-male culture that can make women and other people who don’t fit the mold feel unwelcome, demeaned or even endangered."

The best solution for the problem is a tough one indeed.  The culture is full of "bros", or alpha-male characters, usually not working around women.  This creates a very comfortable environment for males to joke around, be inconsiderate, or even bully women. And when it is too much, and women want to push back, the response can be defensive at best, and violent, like threats of rape and death threats at worst. I believe for there to be a change in a positive direction for this case, we must realize how important diversity is in our leadership and design processes, market to women about changing to this career, and have serious, but rehabilitative repurcussions in place for inappropriate behavior towards women in the workplace.
