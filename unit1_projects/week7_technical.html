    <h1>What the heck is <strong> SQL Injection</strong>?</h1>
    <p> SQL Injection started back in 1998, but is still at the top of the most commonly used hacker attacks considered one of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities of 2007 and 2010 by the Open Web Application Security Project. In 2013, SQLI was rated the number one attack on the OWASP top ten.  So, honestly, this is something that every programmer working with web applications should know and understand. It works like this: Hackers can use the field input sections to add more than just the required name or email values.  Using the multiple line function in some SQL dbms, they can add SQL queries to the values entered to actually control the SQL databases behind the scenes of the login page.  It takes some creativity, and know-how, because they must be familiar with SQL queries and the table names used in the database.  But if they can guess the table name they are trying to access, they can have access to the information for different and malicious reasons.  If you don't want to give away your information, and/or access to losing your information, then you must protect it.  How do I do that? I'm glad you asked.

    <p> Parameterized queries is the most popular and widely used response to SQL Injection.  There are other methods, like using an SQL dbm (database management system) that only allows for single line queries, instead of multiple line ones.  While this allows protection against security threats, it can be highly annoying if you have to write many different single line queries in a database with a lot of information in it. Therefore, the most popular form is still parameterized queries.  In using parameterized queries you remove access directly to your database by supplying the parameters in question at the time of execution.
