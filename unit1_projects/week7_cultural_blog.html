    <p>  How can my values help me mediate stereotype threat, in myself and others, when I recognize it.  This is a deep question. My values come from my upbringing, and the experiences I have been through.  However, many times in my past, my upbringing has dragged me through some unknown form of stereotype threat.  I have only recently learned of stereotype threat as a subject, butI have long been familiar with its effects. I would spare those that I see going through it these same burdens that I have carried.

    <div id="bottom"><p> I try to value and respect others based on their simple membership in the human race.  It's usually a surprise when they prove to me that they don't feel the same. Stereotype threat however, is a much greater detriment because sometimes it comes from the values themselves, that people hold.  My father has always wished me success and achievement, but unknowingly, granted me a form of stereotype threat.  He would remind me that I had to be better than my peers, just to be even with them.  That was pressure than I was looking for, and sometimes more than I could justify.  Why did I need to be treated differently? Why couldn't I just be myself?  

    Likewise, when my friends would celebrate my success with me, whether it was academic or grammatically, they would comment something like, "I don't even see you as black, I just see you as Isaac." I know what this was supposed to mean, and a part of me identified with gratitude for their offering, but it also reminded me of how we were different, and what that meant to them about others like me.  If I see anyone suffering from this malady, I won't try either of those methods.  I will most likely just get them something to drink and sit with them for a little while.  Because silence, and just the presence of a good friend, can speak more than volumes of the best intentions.  

    I like to use positive affirmations when i am feeling down, whenever I rarely allow myself to get there.  But I have always thought that the best offense is a great defense, so I guard my thoughts and self-speak.  It is the best way not to be somewhere I don't want to be.
