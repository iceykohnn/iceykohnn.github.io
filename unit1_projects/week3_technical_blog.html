    <h1>WHY IS JAVASCRIPT SO<strong> POPULAR</strong>?</h1>
    <p>Why is Javascript so flabbernackin popular?

That's because it's pretty easy to learn if you are familiar with C, the language. Javascript resembles C. There wasn't a mjor learning curve there, so programmers found it easier to acclimate to.  It is also easier to use due to it's popularity, because Javascript has libraries for everything making the building of sites much easier and faster. People tend to use it more, increasing demand for easier usage. Javascript is faster still, however, because it's client side therefore reducing load on server. Which equals faster.
