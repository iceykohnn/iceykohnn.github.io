    <p>  My take on the DBC experience is one of agreement.  I listened to the fireside chat and to be honest, while I did learn something, I wasn't surprised by what I learned.  I have been to a tutoring session already, and it allowed me to go downtown (Chicago) and see the space.  I saw people there who seemed like they were pretty close. I guessed that the experience had brought them together, and that it had probably also changed them as well.  I talked to my tutor about it, and he agreed.  We were looking at people who had come here just I am going to, afraid and eager, ready and willing, terrified and desperate.  But they had just graduated, and the looks on there faces, and the laughter in their voices was awesomely encouraging.  A food delivery guy brought some food, but no one claimed it.  He called the number of the one who purchased it, and it turned out that they were at home!  The fact that they ordered food, and were under the habit of having it deliver to the space so funny to everyone, but to me it showed the hard work ethic, the unity and the understanding shared by everyone there.  They all knew the feeling and were enjoying the companionship of their cohort.  I really didn't want to leave. These people had taken charge of their fate and enjoying the company of the ones who they had rode to fate with.  I want this so bad.  I want to be an alumni, who went through the challenges that bring this as a reward.  One of the rewards.  My expectations have been stacked higher, I want to change my outlook, my horizons, my caliber of co-workers.  This is it, Elizabeth.  This is the big one!  I am nervous, but also excited.  Honestly, I don't think any of us would want to give this chance up to be forced to take the blue pill and go back into our old existences.  We are all here begging for change.  I cannot wait.
